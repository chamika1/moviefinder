## Description

This project helps users search for movie download links using Google Dorks. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Google Custom Search API.

## Features

*   Search for movies using various Google Dork templates (MP4, MKV, Directory Listing, etc.).
*   Requires a Google Custom Search API Key and Search Engine ID for full functionality.
*   Provides a demo mode if API keys are not entered.
*   Displays search results with title, link, and snippet.
*   Allows users to visit the link, copy it, or perform a basic analysis.
